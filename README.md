# S525-IE-Project
University of Massachusetts Amherst 2017, Stats 525


S525-IE at UMass refers to a course designation under the Integrative Experience (IE) requirement for mathematics or statistics students at UMass. Specifically, the IE designation includes certain upper-division Math or Statistics courses such as MATH 455, MATH 456, MATH 475, and STATISTC 525. This means that STATISTC 525 is one of the courses students can take to fulfill the Integrative Experience requirement as part of their degree program in mathematics or statistics at UMass.
